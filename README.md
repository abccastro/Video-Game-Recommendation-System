# Video Game Recommendation System

The project's goal is to offer recommendations for video games by taking into account various factors such as the game's genre, platform, ratings, and both critic and user scores. This initiative will benefit individuals who are interested in discovering new games based on a particular title and platform, as well as businesses involved in the video games industry who seek to gain a deeper understanding of its trends and workings.

The application has utilized an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called "NearestNeighbors" to create a model that can recommend video games to users based on the game title as their input. Additionally, users will have the ability to specify the platform of the game they're interested in.

Features used to develop the model:

- Genre: Genre of the video game
- Platform: Platform to play the video game
- Rating: The ESRB ratings
- Critic Score: Aggregated score compiled by Metacritic staff
- User Score: Aggregated score by Metacritic's subscribers

The datasets were obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings.
