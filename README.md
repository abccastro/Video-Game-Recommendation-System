# Video Game Recommendation System

The aim of the project is to provide video game suggestions that consider various factors like game genre, platform, ratings, critic and user scores. This effort will benefit people who want to explore new games based on a particular platform or title.

To achieve this, the project has employed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called "NearestNeighbors" to build a model that can recommend video games to users based on their input of the game's title. Moreover, users will be able to specify the game platform they are interested in.
The following are the features that were used to develop the model:

- Genre: Genre of the video game
- Platform: Platform to play the video game
- Rating: The ESRB ratings
- Critic Score: Aggregated score compiled by Metacritic staff
- User Score: Aggregated score by Metacritic's subscribers

The datasets were obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings.
